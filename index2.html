<h2><b>A wide range of cats' behaviors:</h2></b>
<ul>
<li><b>1. Purring</b>
Meaning: Contentment, relaxation, or self-soothing when in pain or stressed.
Context: Cats purr when theyâ€™re happy (e.g., during petting or snuggling), but they can also purr when feeling unwell or anxious as a way to calm themselves.</li>
<li><b>2. Kneading</b>
Meaning: Comfort or contentment, often linked to kittenhood behavior.
Context: Cats press their paws alternately into soft surfaces, a sign they feel secure. It mimics the motion kittens make to stimulate milk from their mother.</li>
<li><b>3. Meowing</b>
Meaning: Communication with humans (not other cats).
Context: Cats meow to get attention, signal hunger, request entry/exit, or express discomfort. Each cat has its own vocal "language."</li>
