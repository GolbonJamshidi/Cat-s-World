<h1>Cats Info:</h1>

<section>
          <h2>Cats are fascinating and independent creatures</h2>
          <p>Known for their curious and <em><b>playful</em></b> nature. Domesticated for thousands of years, they have a long history of companionship with humans. Cats are members of the Felidae family, making them relatives of wild cats like lions and tigers.</p> 
          <p>Their sharp claws, keen eyesight, and excellent balance help them be agile and effective <u>hunters</u>, even in domestic settings.</p>

 <h2>Cats are also known for their distinct personalities.</h2>
<p>Ranging from affectionate and social to more reserved and <em><b>independent.</em></b>
They communicate through body language, vocalizations (like purring or meowing), and their eyes and tails.</p>
<p> Though they are independent, they form strong bonds with their owners, often enjoying cuddles and play.<p>
